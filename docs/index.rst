Goal
----

This page is dedicated to the documentation of my machine learning adventurers. I have decided
to document my machine learning experiences in order to teach myself as well as to share with others.

---------------------------------


`Concrete`_ Is a multi parameter linear regression model developed to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on the
quantities of the concrete mixture.
