About me
--------

My name is Vincent. I am a civil engineer by day and a hacker on my spare time.

My professional interests lie in the application of computing in civil infrastructure monitoring, machine learning for
infrastructure health monitoring and anomaly detection . My personal interests lie in having fun with computers and
micro-controllers.

I did my undergrad at Queen’s University in civil engineering. I then pursued with a master’s in structural engineering
at McGill University. After working for 5 years,  I went back to school to do a second master’s in technology and
project management from Portland State University. Furthermore, I have undertaken courses in computer science with the
University of Rimouski and a graduate certificate in computing with the Oregon Institute of Technology. I am currently
taking a course in Statistical Learning at McGill University.

Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated with computers. This started the day my father came home with a
TI-994A. Since only a handful of games were available at the time, programming quickly became a past time. In the early
80′s when I started high school, computer classes consisted of teaching the basics of programming using a Commodore
VIC-20. Well lets just say that this is the one areas of school where I excelled.


  
Goal
----

This page is dedicated to the documentation of my machine learning adventurers. I have decided
to document my machine learning experiences in order to teach myself as well as to share with others.

I am currently following a statistical learning course at McGill University



I am also reading the following machine learning books:

- An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems 1st Edition by Aurélien Géron.
- Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython 2nd Edition by Wes McKinney.


Statistical learning course
---------------------------

`Assignment1`_ The following Jupyter NoteBook demonstrates the use of different types of distribution (Bernouille, binomial, poisson) to
understand probability distributions, expected values and varaince.

.. _Assignment1: https://github.com/vinoroy/machineAdventures/blob/master/docs/assignment01_spring2019_VincentRoy.ipynb


`Assignment2`_ The following Jupyter NoteBook demonstrates the use of Linear regression and Classification models (Logistic
regression, LDA and QDA)

.. _Assignment2: https://github.com/vinoroy/machineAdventures/blob/master/docs/assignment02_spring2019_VincentRoy.ipynb


`Assignment3`_ The following Jupyter NoteBook demonstrates the use of cross-validation and model regularization

.. _Assignment3: https://github.com/vinoroy/machineAdventures/blob/master/docs/assignment03-spring2019_VincentRoy.ipynb

`Assignment4`_ The following is a pdf presentation that I gave to my class for an insurance risk reduction case study that
used a logistic model and a decision tree to identify and predict the chance of heart disease for future insurance clients

.. _Assignment4: https://github.com/vinoroy/machineAdventures/blob/master/docs/assignment04-spring2019_VincentRoy.pdf



Multi parameter linear regression models 
----------------------------------------


`Concrete`_ is a multi parameter linear regression model developed to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on the
quantities of the concrete mixture.

.. _Concrete: https://github.com/vinoroy/machineAdventures/blob/master/docs/concrete.ipynb



Classification models
---------------------

`Iris`_ is a classification problem where a logisitics regression model and a decision tree model are used for the classification of
three types of Iris flowers.
