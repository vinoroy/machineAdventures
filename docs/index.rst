Goal
----

This page is dedicated to the documentation of my machine learning adventurers. I have decided
to document my machine learning experiences in order to teach myself as well as to share with others.

I am currently following a statistical learning course at McGill University



I am also reading the following machine learning books:

- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems 1st Edition by Aurélien Géron.
- Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython 2nd Edition by Wes McKinney.


Statistical learning course
---------------------------

`Assignment1`_ The following Jupyter NoteBook demonstrates the use of different types of distribution (Bernouille, binomial, poisson) to
understand probability distributions, expected values and varaince.


.. _Assignment1:: https://github.com/vinoroy/machineAdventures/blob/master/docs/assignment01_spring2019_VincentRoy.ipynb



`Assignment2`_ The following Jupyter NoteBook demonstrates the use of Linear regression and Classification models (Logistic
regression, LDA and QDA)


.. _Assignment2:: https://github.com/vinoroy/machineAdventures/blob/master/docs/assignment02_spring2019_VincentRoy.ipynb


Multi parameter linear regression models 
----------------------------------------


`Concrete`_ is a multi parameter linear regression model developed to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on the
quantities of the concrete mixture.

.. _Concrete: https://github.com/vinoroy/machineAdventures/blob/master/docs/concrete.ipynb



Classification models
---------------------

`Iris`_ is a classification problem where a logisitics regression model and a decision tree model are used for the classification of
three types of Iris flowers.
