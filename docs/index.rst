This page is dedicated to the documentation of my machine learning adventurers. I have decided
to document my machine learning experiences in order to teach myself as well as to share with others.

I am currently following the `Andrew`_ Ng Cousera course on Machine learning. This is an exellente course, since it goes into the details
of the different algorthims. This in my opion, is very important in order to understand what the algorithms are doing.

I am also reading the following machine learning books:

- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems 1st Edition by Aurélien Géron.
- Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython 2nd Edition by Wes McKinney.



Multi parameter linear regression models 
----------------------------------------


`Concrete`_ is a multi parameter linear regression model developed to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on the
quantities of the concrete mixture.

Classification models
---------------------

`Iris`_ is a classification problem where a logisitics regression model and a decision tree model are used for the classification of
three types of Iris flowers.
